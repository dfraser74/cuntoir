//Reddits suggestions
Build a setup utility
    -Generate placeholder keyfiles
    -Create a dump of the database framework that can be auto-loaded into mysql to get the app up and running
    -Re-build support for invite codes
    -Write custom api request using requests to set up new users if there's an invite code in place

Build a database connection handler class

Unify configuration files somehow

Refactor code base at some point
\\

//To make self hosting worth it, and becuase I want this to be free now
Remove stripe integration, or atleast just make it non-functional for now
    -Can probably make all "premium" checks return true, and then just slowly phase it out
\\

//Probably going to discard in future
Android/iOs native app
    -It begins...
    -Adandon hope all ye who enter here
    -Wrap your head around react native some time
    -Turns out phonegap is kinda shitty

Look into Electron for native desktop application

Make shared tasks? Maybe?
    -Need a level of authorisation that says can-edit or can-view
    -Add tasks a user has had shared to them into getAll
    -This is kinda a hard problem based on current infrastructure
\\

//low on the priority list as tasks more than a couple of years old shouldn't be common
!!!!BUGFIXES!!!!
    -Really old dated tasks move forward an hour when they're edited
