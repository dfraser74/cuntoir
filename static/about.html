        <p>Cúntóir is a task manament and todo list app, designed for use with android mobile, chrome and firefox, however, it will work with reduced functionality (no push notifications or offline functionality) on other browsers.</p><p>It was built by an engineering student from Ireland, and the name Cúntóir is the irish word for helper, or assistant. Cúntóir is hosted on Amazon web service infrastructure, with a javascript client and a python based server, and it was built as a summer project to learn more about service and app web development, but eventually became a usable app in it's own right. Hosting costs are high, so please feel free to leave something in the <a href="https://www.paypal.me/cuntoir/5" target="_blank">tip jar </a> if you like it. Please contact me at the contact email above if you have any questions.</p><p><a href="https://cuntoir.com"><b>Back to Cúntóir</b></a></p>
